# TerpTacker Next 

## Tech Stack

This project is created using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). Which is a collection of open source technologies centering around NextJS and typescript.

It includes the following:

1. Frontend and backend server via [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
2. Authentication via [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
3. Database via [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)
4. API via [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
5. Styling via [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
6. Language via [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Deployment and Hosting

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

This handles deployment of this NextJS application. On push to the master branch a new deployment is shipped automatically.

The vercel organization page can be found here: https://vercel.com/terpmetrix/

### [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/)

This is a hosted MySQL database. It is used to store all of the data for the application.

Super easy to use. Super good UI.

Dashboard for current database: https://app.planetscale.com/terpmetrix

## User Interface Kits

I used [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) to create the UI for this project. It is a tailwindcss plugin that adds a bunch of components and utilities to make it easier to create a UI.
